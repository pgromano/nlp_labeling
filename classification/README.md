# Text Classification

Example of dynamic web-app for labeling text for classification purposes. This example is set up for sentiment on the IMDB dataset (not provided) to capture **postitive**, **negative**, and **unclear** labels with keyboard shortcuts `y`, `n`, `?` respectively.

This is a naive and overly simplistic example and can be expanded to provide more flexibility for input and output.
